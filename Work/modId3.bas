' Now about the Genre
' It works like this, it contains a code in numbers ranging form 1 to 147
' each of these numbers represents a certain Genre like "HipHop" = 7 etc etc.
' the guy who maid the Id3 Tags made a list for the codes and there were originally 80 of them
' then the dudes at winamp extended this so today there are about 150
' this is a pain in the ass to figure out, still there are some info about this on the www.
' Now, a very cool person by the name of Leigh Bowers, has done this. you can search for the code
' on planet source, "MP3Snatch v2.0", but that code has a couple of flaws in the genre part as it uses
' a string*21 instead of a Byte, and on that code you cant write the tag, only read it.
' so i have included Leighs code wich has 147 of the Genre's, very cool.


' if you want the Genre directly, try filling a combobox with the GenreArray and then use combo1.listindex to match the Genre(code) (number)
